const prompt = require('prompt-sync')()
// Task 1
// Define a function that makes the API call to the request URL you defined in the worksheet (to get 3 dog artworks)
// Make sure to console log all 3 titles 



// Call the function and confirm it worked correctly


// Task 2
// Define another function that takes in a search query and a size limit
// Copy the function above and modify it to make the API call with the function parameters instead
// Note: you will likely need a for loop to print all the titles



// Test this function by prompting the user to enter a query and size limit (two separate prompts)


// Call the new function with the user inputs and confirm it worked correctly
